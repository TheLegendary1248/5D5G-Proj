# First Game Jam Game
 A unfinished top-down hypercasual game that failed twice so far
 The original game was made for the [5 Days 5 Games Jam](https://itch.io/c/1323094/5-days-5-games-challenge), where 5 games were supposed to be made over 5 days
 I picked the jam at random, and to maybe learn a bit of time management, and did not deliver on either goal, *nor much did anyone else*
 Created on **12/20/20**, according to itch.io timestamp

 As it stands, the game is only partially complete compared to where it's heading, and has had quite a bit of work on it
 A hypercasual, top-down 2D 'platformer' game, where any collision kills you instantly because during the work of a day, could not for the life of me figure out a solution for a sort of collision behaviour, so i instead opted for insta-death
